# 📺 Netflix Data Analysis

Welcome to my very first data analysis project! 🎉  
In this project, I explored a sample Netflix dataset using Python to uncover some cool insights like which genres are most popular, how Netflix content has grown over the years, and how many shows are movies vs TV shows.

This was a hands-on way to practice real data cleaning, visualization, and basic exploration using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## 🔍 What I Explored

Here’s what I did step by step:

- Looked at the dataset to understand what’s inside
- Found the most popular genres and top content-producing countries
- Compared how much of the content is movies vs TV shows
- Analyzed how Netflix’s content has changed over the years
- Created simple visualizations to show those trends clearly
